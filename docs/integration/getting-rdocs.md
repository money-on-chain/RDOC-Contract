# Getting RDOCs

A RDOC, RIF On Chain, is a RIF-collateralized stable-coin. Its value is pegged to one dollar.

That RDOC is an _ERC20_ Token means that any user that has already some tokens can trade them to you in exchange for a service or for another token. You can find specific information about ERC-20 tokens [here](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-20.md).
