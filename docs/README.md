# Introduction

RIF On Chain is a suite of smart contracts dedicated to providing a RIF-collateralized stable-coin, Dollar On Chain, (RDOC); a passive income hodler-targeted token, RIFPro (RIFP), and a leveraged RIF investment instrument (RIFX series).

RIF On Chain runs on the [RSK network](https://www.rsk.co/) and uses the RIF token as reserve assets to back RIF On Chain. You can find more info on the RIF token and decentralized economies [here](https://www.rifos.org/).

The rationale behind this is that deposits of RIF help collateralize the RDOCs, RIFPro absorbs the USD-RIF rate fluctuations, and RIF2X is leveraged borrowing value from RIFPro and RDOC holders, with a daily interest rate being paid to the former.
